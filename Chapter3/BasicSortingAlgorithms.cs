There has been tons of studies done on how to sort data most effectively. 
They're also exteremely complicated. So this chpater will be three simple ones first:

This will use ArrayTestBed.cs to implement the Bubble Sort:
The bubble sort is one of the slowest algorithms available BUT it is simple and easy to study.
The sort gets its name because values “float like a bubble” from one end of
the list to another. Assuming you are sorting a list of numbers in ascending
order, higher values float to the right whereas lower values float to the left.
This behavior is caused by moving through the list many times, comparing
adjacent values and swapping them if the value to the left is greater than the
value to the right.
